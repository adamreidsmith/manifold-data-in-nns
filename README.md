# Investigation manifold-values data in neural networks
The objective of this project is to study and evaluate methods for training neural networks on manifold-valued data. Current methods often neglect the manifold structure, and lead to ineffective and/or inefficient networks. Preprocessing techniques and various network structures will be studied for data on various manifolds with the goal of obtaining an efficient and effective neural network architecture.  The project is described in more detail in [`manifold_data_in_nn.pdf`](./manifold_data_in_nn.pdf).
